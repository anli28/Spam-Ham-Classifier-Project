# Spam-Ham-Classifier-Project
Created a data pipeline to process and build a logistic regression model to predict whether an email is spam or ham (non-spam) with a 94.8% accuracy on the test set. Used cross-validation for feature and model selection to avoid overfitting of training data and validated the performance by generating a ROC curve.
